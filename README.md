## Developer Notes

This project uses [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) for compiling CSS. To update the CSS, open two terminals. Run `npm run sass-watch` - this will watch for any changes made to the SASS files and compile them to the style.css used by the index.html file. Run `npm start` in the second terminal, to create a live server, and see changes made in the browser [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
